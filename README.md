# Inches to Millimeters Converter

## Convert inches to millimeters and vice versa

### Description

What sets this tool apart from others online is its unique use of
fractions for inputting and outputting values during conversions. While
most tools provide output in decimal form, this one gives you results in
fractions, which is far more useful in real-life scenarios.

The first version of this tool was developed for an application I
created for one of my employers, specifically for generating invoices
for interior design projects. Users often need to convert measurements
from millimeters to inches and prefer the results in fractions rather
than decimals. Existing tools didnâ€™t offer the convenience and speed
that users expected.

I developed this tool to meet those needs, providing an easy and fast
way to perform multiple conversions, seamlessly integrated into the
existing application. This current version is a showcase piece for my
portfolio, demonstrating my ability to tackle complex projects as a
software developer. Although it looks different from the one built for
the application, the inner workings remain the same.
