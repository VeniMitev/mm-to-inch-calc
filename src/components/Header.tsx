        What sets this tool apart from others online is its unique use of
        fractions for inputting and outputting values during conversions. While
        most tools provide output in decimal form, this one gives you results in
        fractions, which is far more useful in real-life scenarios.

      <p className='text-sm max-w-prose'>
        The first version of this tool was developed for an application I
        created for one of my employers, specifically for generating invoices
        for interior design projects. Users often need to convert measurements
        from millimeters to inches and prefer the results in fractions rather
        than decimals. Existing tools didn’t offer the convenience and speed
        that users expected.
      </p>

      <p className='text-sm max-w-prose'>
        I developed this tool to meet those needs, providing an easy and fast
        way to perform multiple conversions, seamlessly integrated into the
        existing application. This current version is a showcase piece for my
        portfolio, demonstrating my ability to tackle complex projects as a
        software developer. Although it looks different from the one built for
        the application, the inner workings remain the same.
